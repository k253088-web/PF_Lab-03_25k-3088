I am Batool Zehra, pursuing Software Engineering from FAST NUCES, Karachi.
I began my programming journey with HTML, C, and C++, which built a strong foundation for problem-solving.
My interests now focus on artificial intelligence, algorithms, and innovative software development.
I am eager to keep learning emerging technologies and applying them to create real-world impact.
